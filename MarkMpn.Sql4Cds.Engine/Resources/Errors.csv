3002,16,Cannot BACKUP or RESTORE a database snapshot.
3003,10,This BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL will be based on more than one file backup. All those file backups must be restored before attempting to restore this differential backup.
3004,16,The primary filegroup cannot be backed up as a file backup because the database is using the SIMPLE recovery model. Consider taking a partial backup by specifying READ_WRITE_FILEGROUPS.
3005,10,The differential partial backup is including a read-only filegroup, '%ls'. This filegroup was read-write when the base partial backup was created, but was later changed to read-only access. We recommend that you create a separate file backup of the '%ls' filegroup now, and then create a new partial backup to provide a new base for later differential partial backups.
3006,16,The differential backup is not allowed because it would be based on more than one base backup. Multi-based differential backups are not allowed in the simple recovery model, and are never allowed for partial differential backups.
3007,16,The backup of the file or filegroup "%ls" is not permitted because it is not online. Container state: "%ls" (%d). Restore status: %d. BACKUP can be performed by using the FILEGROUP or FILE clauses to restrict the selection to include only online data.
3008,16,The specified device type is not supported for backup mirroring.
3009,16,Could not insert a backup or restore history/detail record in the msdb database. This may indicate a problem with the msdb database. The backup/restore operation was still successful.

3015,10,%hs is not yet implemented.
3016,16,Backup of file '%ls' is not permitted because it contains pages subject to an online restore sequence. Complete the restore sequence before taking the backup, or restrict the backup to exclude this file.
3017,16,The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' could not be opened. Operating system error '%ls'. Correct the problem, or reissue the command without RESTART.
3018,10,The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was not found. The RESTORE command will continue from the beginning as if RESTART had not been specified.
3019,16,The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' is from a previous interrupted RESTORE operation and is inconsistent with the current RESTORE command. The restart command must use the same syntax as the interrupted command, with the addition of the RESTART clause. Alternatively, reissue the current statement without the RESTART clause.
3021,16,Cannot perform a backup or restore operation within a transaction.
3022,10,This backup is a file backup of read-write data from a database that uses the simple recovery model. This is only appropriate if you plan to set the filegroup to read-only followed by a differential file backup. Consult Books Online for more information on managing read-only data for the simple recovery model. In particular, consider how partial backups are used.
3023,16,Backup, file manipulation operations (such as ALTER DATABASE ADD FILE) and encryption changes on a database must be serialized. Reissue the statement after the current backup or file manipulation operation is completed.
3024,16,You can only perform a full backup of the master database. Use BACKUP DATABASE to back up the entire master database.
3025,16,Missing database name. Reissue the statement specifying a valid database name.
3027,16,The filegroup "%.*ls" is not part of database "%.*ls".
3028,10,The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was corrupted and is being ignored. The RESTORE command will continue from the beginning as if RESTART had not been specified.
3030,16,Value of '%ls' must be less than or equal to value of '%ls'. Change the values and reissue the BACKUP statement.
3031,16,Option '%ls' conflicts with option(s) '%ls'. Remove the conflicting option and reissue the statement.
3032,16,One or more of the options (%ls) are not supported for this statement. Review the documentation for supported options.
3033,16,BACKUP DATABASE cannot be used on a database opened in emergency mode.
3034,16,No files were selected to be processed. You may have selected one or more filegroups that have no members.
3035,16,Cannot perform a differential backup for database "%ls", because a current database backup does not exist. Perform a full database backup by reissuing BACKUP DATABASE, omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option.
3036,16,The database "%ls" is in warm-standby state (set by executing RESTORE WITH STANDBY) and cannot be backed up until the entire restore sequence is completed.
3038,16,The file name "%ls" is invalid as a backup device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid file name.
3039,16,Cannot perform a differential backup for file '%ls' because a current file backup does not exist. Reissue BACKUP DATABASE omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option.
3040,10,An error occurred while informing replication of the backup. The backup will continue, but the replication environment should be inspected.
3041,16,BACKUP failed to complete the command %.*ls. Check the backup application log for detailed messages.
3042,10,BACKUP WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR successfully generated a backup of the damaged database. Refer to the SQL Server error log for information about the errors that were encountered.
3043,16,BACKUP '%ls' detected an error on page (%d:%d) in file '%ls'.
3044,16,Invalid zero-length device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name.
3045,16,BACKUP or RESTORE requires the NTFS file system for FILESTREAM and full-text support. The path "%.*ls" is not usable.
3046,16,Inconsistent metadata has been encountered. The only possible backup operation is a tail-log backup using the WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR or NO_TRUNCATE option.
3047,16,The BackupDirectory registry key is not configured correctly. This key should specify the root path where disk backup files are stored when full path names are not provided. This path is also used to locate restart checkpoint files for RESTORE.
3049,16,BACKUP detected corruption in the database log. Check the errorlog for more information.
3050,16,SQL Server could not send the differential information for database file '%ls' of database '%ls\\%ls' to the backup application because the differential information is too large to fit in memory, and an attempt to use a temporary file has failed.
3051,16,BACKUP LOG was unable to maintain mirroring consistency for database '%ls'. Database mirroring has been suspended.
3052,16,BACKUP LOG was unable to log updates for for database '%ls'. Subsequent log backups will be required to advance the backup point from %S_LSN to %S_LSN after log space is made available for logging them.
3053,16,BACKUP '%ls' detected an error on a page in file '%ls'.
3054,16,Differential file backups can include only read-only data for databases using the simple recovery model. Consider taking a partial backup by specifying READ_WRITE_FILEGROUPS.
3055,16,Backup destination "%.*ls" supports a FILESTREAM filegroup. This filegroup cannot be used as a backup destination. Rerun the BACKUP statement with a valid backup destination.
3056,16,The backup operation has detected an unexpected file in a FILESTREAM container. The backup operation will continue and include file '%ls'.
3057,16,Invalid device name. The length of the device name provided exceeds supported limit (maximum length is:%d). Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name.
3058,10,File or device name exceeds the supported limit (maximum length is:%d) and will be truncated: %.*ls.
3059,16,This BACKUP or RESTORE command is not supported on a database mirror or secondary replica.
3060,10,The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was corrupted. The restored database can not be recovered.  Restart the RESTORE sequence.
3061,16,The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' could not be opened.  Operating system error '%ls'.  Make the file available and retry the operation or, restart the RESTORE sequence.

3094,16,Server '%.*ls' has no user databases to suspend for snapshot backup.
3095,16,The backup cannot be performed because 'ENCRYPTION' was requested after the media was formatted with an incompatible structure. To append to this media set, either omit 'ENCRYPTION' or create a new media set by using WITH FORMAT in your BACKUP statement. If you use WITH FORMAT on an existing media set, all its backup sets will be overwritten.
3096,16,The Certificate specified for backup encryption has expired.
3097,16,The Backup cannot be performed because the existing media set is formatted with an incompatible version.
3098,16,The backup cannot be performed because '%ls' was requested after the media was formatted with an incompatible structure. To append to this media set, either omit '%ls' or specify '%ls'. Alternatively, you can create a new media set by using WITH FORMAT in your BACKUP statement. If you use WITH FORMAT on an existing media set, all its backup sets will be overwritten.
3099,16,Backup Encryption options were specified, Backup Encryption support has not been enabled on this version.
3101,16,Exclusive access could not be obtained because the database is in use.
3102,16,%ls cannot process database '%ls' because it is in use by this session. It is recommended that the master database be used when performing this operation.
3103,16,A partial restore sequence cannot be initiated by this command. To initiate a partial restore sequence, use the WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement and provide a backup set which includes a full copy of at least the primary data file. The WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement may not be used for any other purpose.
3104,16,RESTORE cannot operate on database '%ls' because it is configured for database mirroring or has joined an availability group. If you intend to restore the database, use ALTER DATABASE to remove mirroring or to remove the database from its availability group.
3105,16,RESTORE cannot restore any more pages into file '%ls' because the maximum number of pages (%d) are already being restored. Either complete the restore sequence for the existing pages, or use RESTORE FILE to restore all pages in the file.
3106,16,The filegroup "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the filegroup that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the filegroup in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command.
3107,16,The file "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the file that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the file in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command.
3108,16,To restore the master database, the server must be running in single-user mode. For information on starting in single-user mode, see "How to: Start an Instance of SQL Server (sqlservr.exe)" in Books Online.
3109,16,Master can only be restored and fully recovered in a single step using a full database backup. Options such as NORECOVERY, STANDBY, and STOPAT are not supported.
3110,14,User does not have permission to RESTORE database '%.*ls'.
3111,16,Page %S_PGID is a control page which cannot be restored in isolation. To repair this page, the entire file must be restored.
3112,16,Cannot restore any database other than master when the server is in single user mode.
3113,16,Invalid data was detected.
3115,16,The database is using the simple recovery model. It is not possible to restore a subset of the read-write data.
3116,16,The supplied backup is not on the same recovery path as the database, and is ineligible for use for an online file restore.
3117,16,The log or differential backup cannot be restored because no files are ready to rollforward.
3118,16,The database "%ls" does not exist. RESTORE can only create a database when restoring either a full backup or a file backup of the primary file.
3119,16,Problems were identified while planning for the RESTORE statement. Previous messages provide details.
3120,16,This backup set will not be restored because all data has already been restored to a point beyond the time covered by this backup set.
3121,16,The file "%ls" is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with application of this backup set. RESTORE cannot continue.
3122,16,File initialization failed. RESTORE cannot continue.
3123,16,Invalid database name '%.*ls' specified for backup or restore operation.
3125,16,The database is using the simple recovery model. The data in the backup it is not consistent with the current state of the database. Restoring more data is required before recovery is possible. Either restore a full file backup taken since the data was marked read-only, or restore the most recent base backup for the target data followed by a differential file backup.
3127,16,The file '%.*ls' of restored database '%ls' is being left in the defunct state because the database is using the simple recovery model and the file is marked for read-write access. Therefore, only read-only files can be recovered by piecemeal restore.
3128,16,File '%ls' has an unsupported page size (%d).
3129,16,The contents of the file "%ls" are not consistent with a transition into the restore sequence. A restore from a backup set may be required.
3130,10,The filegroup "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls"'. RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed filegroup.
3131,10,The file "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls". RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed file.
3132,16,The media set has %d media families but only %d are provided. All members must be provided.
3133,16,The volume on device "%ls" is sequence number %d of media family %d, but sequence number %d of media family %d is expected. Check that the device specifications and loaded media are correct.
3134,10,The differential base attribute for file '%ls' of database '%ls' has been reset because the file has been restored from a backup taken on a conflicting recovery path. The restore was allowed because the file was read-only and was consistent with the current status of the database. Any future differential backup of this file will require a new differential base.
3135,16,The backup set in file '%ls' was created by %hs and cannot be used for this restore operation.
3136,16,This differential backup cannot be restored because the database has not been restored to the correct earlier state.
3137,16,Database cannot be reverted. Either the primary or the snapshot names are improperly specified, all other snapshots have not been dropped, or there are missing files.
3138,16,The database cannot be reverted because FILESTREAM BLOBs are present.
3139,16,Restore to snapshot is not allowed with the master database.
3140,16,Could not adjust the space allocation for file '%ls'.
3141,16,The database to be restored was named '%ls'. Reissue the statement using the WITH REPLACE option to overwrite the '%ls' database.
3142,16,File "%ls" cannot be restored over the existing "%ls". Reissue the RESTORE statement using WITH REPLACE to overwrite pre-existing files, or WITH MOVE to identify an alternate location.
3143,16,The data set on device '%ls' is not a SQL Server backup set.
3144,16,File '%.*ls' was not backed up in file %d on device '%ls'. The file cannot be restored from this backup set.
3145,16,The STOPAT option is not supported for databases that use the SIMPLE recovery model.
3147,16,Backup and restore operations are not allowed on database tempdb.
3148,16,This RESTORE statement is invalid in the current context. The 'Recover Data Only' option is only defined for secondary filegroups when the database is in an online state. When the database is in an offline state filegroups cannot be specified.
3149,16,The file or filegroup "%ls" is not in a valid state for the "Recover Data Only" option to be used. Only secondary files in the OFFLINE or RECOVERY_PENDING state can be processed.
3150,10,The master database has been successfully restored. Shutting down SQL Server.
3151,21,Failed to restore master database. Shutting down SQL Server. Check the error logs, and rebuild the master database. For more information about how to rebuild the master database, see SQL Server Books Online.
3153,16,The database is already fully recovered.
3154,16,The backup set holds a backup of a database other than the existing '%ls' database.
3155,16,The RESTORE operation cannot proceed because one or more files have been added or dropped from the database since the backup set was created.
3156,16,File '%ls' cannot be restored to '%ls'. Use WITH MOVE to identify a valid location for the file.
3159,16,The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to backup the log if it contains work you do not want to lose. Use the WITH REPLACE or WITH STOPAT clause of the RESTORE statement to just overwrite the contents of the log.
3161,16,The primary file is unavailable. It must be restored or otherwise made available.
3163,16,The transaction log was damaged. All data files must be restored before RESTORE LOG can be attempted.

3171,16,File %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database.
3172,16,Filegroup %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database.
3173,16,The STOPAT clause provided with this RESTORE statement indicates that the tail of the log contains changes that must be backed up to reach the target point in time. The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to back up the log, or use the WITH REPLACE clause in your RESTORE statement to overwrite the tail of the log.
3174,16,The file '%ls' cannot be moved by this RESTORE operation.
3175,10,RESTORE FILEGROUP="%ls" was specified, but not all of its files are present in the backup set. File "%ls" is missing. RESTORE will continue, but if you want all files to be restored, you must restore other backup sets.

3948,16,The transaction was terminated because of the availability replica config/state change or because ghost records are being deleted on the primary and the secondary availability replica that might be needed by queries running under snapshot isolation. Retry the transaction.
3949,16,Transaction aborted when accessing versioned row in table '%.*ls' in database '%.*ls'. Requested versioned row was not found because the readable secondary access is not allowed for the operation that attempted to create the version. This might be timing related, so try the query again later.
3950,16,Version store scan timed out when attempting to read the next row. Please try the statement again later when the system is not as busy.
3951,16,Transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the statement was run under snapshot isolation but the transaction did not start in snapshot isolation. You cannot change the isolation level of the transaction to snapshot after the transaction has started unless the transaction was originally started under snapshot isolation level.
3952,16,Snapshot isolation transaction failed accessing database '%.*ls' because snapshot isolation is not allowed in this database. Use ALTER DATABASE to allow snapshot isolation.
3953,16,Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the database was not recovered when the current transaction was started. Retry the transaction after the database has recovered.
3954,16,Snapshot isolation transaction failed to start in database '%.*ls' because the ALTER DATABASE command that disallows snapshot isolation had started before this transaction began. The database is in transition to OFF state. You will either need to change the isolation level of the transaction or re-enable the snapshot isolation in the database.
3955,16,Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the recovery was skipped for this database. You must recover the database before you can run a transaction under snapshot isolation.
3956,16,Snapshot isolation transaction failed to start in database '%.*ls' because the ALTER DATABASE command which enables snapshot isolation for this database has not finished yet. The database is in transition to pending ON state. You must wait until the ALTER DATABASE Command completes successfully.
3957,16,Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the database did not allow snapshot isolation when the current transaction started. It may help to retry the transaction.
3958,16,Transaction aborted when accessing versioned row in table '%.*ls' in database '%.*ls'. Requested versioned row was not found. Your tempdb is probably out of space. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.
3959,10,Version store is full. New version(s) could not be added. A transaction that needs to access the version store may be rolled back. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.
3960,16,Snapshot isolation transaction aborted due to update conflict. You cannot use snapshot isolation to access table '%.*ls' directly or indirectly in database '%.*ls' to update, delete, or insert the row that has been modified or deleted by another transaction. Retry the transaction or change the isolation level for the update/delete statement.
3961,16,Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the object accessed by the statement has been modified by a DDL statement in another concurrent transaction since the start of this transaction.  It is disallowed because the metadata is not versioned. A concurrent update to metadata can lead to inconsistency if mixed with snapshot isolation.
3962,16,Bind to another transaction while executing SQL Server internal query is not supported. Check your logon trigger definition and remove any sp_bindsession usage if any. If this error is not happening during logon trigger execution, contact production support team.
3963,16,Transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because distributed transactions are not supported under snapshot isolation.
3964,16,Transaction failed because this DDL statement is not allowed inside a snapshot isolation transaction. Since metadata is not versioned, a metadata change can lead to inconsistency if mixed within snapshot isolation.
3965,16,The PROMOTE TRANSACTION request failed because there is no local transaction active.
3966,17,Transaction is rolled back when accessing version store. It was earlier marked as victim when the version store was shrunk due to insufficient space in tempdb. This transaction was marked as a victim earlier because it may need the row version(s) that have already been removed to make space in tempdb. Retry the transaction
3967,17,Insufficient space in tempdb to hold row versions.  Need to shrink the version store to free up some space in tempdb. Transaction (id=%I64d xsn=%I64d spid=%d elapsed_time=%d) has been marked as victim and it will be rolled back if it accesses the version store. If the problem persists, the likely cause is improperly sized tempdb or long running transactions. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.
3968,10,Snapshot isolation or read committed snapshot is not available in database '%.*ls' because SQL Server was started with one or more undocumented trace flags that prevent enabling database for versioning. Transaction started with snapshot isolation will fail and a query running under read committed snapshot will succeed but will resort back to lock based read committed.
3969,16,Distributed transaction is not supported while running SQL Server internal query. Check your logon trigger definition and remove any distributed transaction usage if any. If this error is not happening during logon trigger execution, contact production support team.

3979,16,The TM request is longer than expected. The request is not processed.
3980,16,The request failed to run because the batch is aborted, this can be caused by abort signal sent from client, or another request is running in the same session, which makes the session busy.
3981,16,The transaction operation cannot be performed because there are pending requests working on this transaction.
3982,16,New transaction is not allowed to be started while DTC or bound transaction is active.
3983,16,The operation failed because the session is not single threaded.
3984,16,Cannot acquire a database lock during a transaction change.

4070,16,More than 255 columns were specified in the COMPUTE clause, and this metadata cannot be sent to a SQL Server version 6.5 client.
4071,10,The XP callback function '%.*ls' failed in extended procedure '%.*ls' because it was executed within an INSERT-EXEC statement which does not allow the extended procedure to send information other than result set.
4072,10,The XP callback function '%.*ls' failed in extended procedure '%.*ls' because the extended procedure is called inside an UDF which doesn't allow sending data.
4073,16,A return value of data type varchar(max), nvarchar(max), varbinary(max), XML or other large object type can not be returned to client driver versions earlier than SQL Server 2005.  Please resubmit the query using a more recent client driver.

4116,16,The function 'ntile' takes only a positive int or bigint expression as its input.
4117,16,Cannot retrieve table data for the query operation because the table "%.*ls" schema is being altered too frequently. Because the table "%.*ls" contains a computed column, changes to the table schema require a refresh of all table data. Retry the query operation, and if the problem persists, use SQL Server Profiler to identify what schema-altering operations are occurring.
4118,16,An invalid expression was specified in the FOR UPDATE clause.

4177,16,The FROM clause of a PROB_MATCH query must consist of a single derived table.
4184,16,Cannot retrieve table data for the query operation because the table "%.*ls" schema is being altered too frequently. Because the table "%.*ls" contains a filtered index or filtered statistics, changes to the table schema require a refresh of all table data. Retry the query operation, and if the problem persists, use SQL Server Profiler to identify what schema-altering operations are occurring.
4185,16,This action cannot be performed on a system type.
4186,16,Column '%ls.%.*ls' cannot be referenced in the OUTPUT clause because the column definition contains a subquery or references a function that performs user or system data access. A function is assumed by default to perform data access if it is not schemabound. Consider removing the subquery or function from the column definition or removing the column from the OUTPUT clause.
4187,16,Data type %ls of receiving variable cannot store all values of the data type %ls of column '%.*ls' without data loss.
4188,16,Column or parameter '%.*ls' has type '%ls' and collation '%.*ls'. The legacy LOB types do not support UTF-8 or UTF-16 encodings. Use types varchar(max), nvarchar(max) or a collation which does not have the _SC or _UTF8 flags.
4189,16,Cannot convert to text/ntext or collate to '%.*ls' because these legacy LOB types do not support UTF-8 or UTF-16 encodings. Use types varchar(max), nvarchar(max) or a collation which does not have the _SC or _UTF8 flags.

4212,16,Cannot back up the log of the master database. Use BACKUP DATABASE instead.
4214,16,BACKUP LOG cannot be performed because there is no current database backup.
4215,10,The log was not truncated because records at the beginning of the log are pending replication or Change Data Capture. Ensure the Log Reader Agent or capture job is running or use sp_repldone to mark transactions as distributed or captured.
4217,10,BACKUP LOG cannot modify the database because the database is read-only. The backup will continue, although subsequent backups will duplicate the work of this backup.
4218,16,Bulk-logged operations exist in the database. Perform a BACKUP LOG.
4219,10,The log backup chain is broken. You must perform a full database backup before you can perform a log backup.
4220,16,Cannot back up the log of the model database with NORECOVERY option.
4221,16,Login to read-secondary failed due to long wait on 'HADR_DATABASE_WAIT_FOR_TRANSITION_TO_VERSIONING'. The replica is not available for login because row versions are missing for transactions that were in-flight when the replica was recycled. The issue can be resolved by rolling back or committing the active transactions on the primary replica. Occurrences of this condition can be minimized by avoiding long write transactions on the primary.
4222,16,The log backup cannot be performed with the provided MAX_VLF_COUNT option.
4223,16,The log backup cannot be performed with the provided MAX_VLF_COUNT option on Hadron secondaries.
4302,16,The option "%ls" conflicts with online restore. Remove the conflicting option and reissue the command.
4303,16,The roll forward start point is now at log sequence number (LSN) %.*s. Additional roll forward past LSN %.*s is required to complete the restore sequence.
4305,16,The log in this backup set begins at LSN %.*ls, which is too recent to apply to the database. An earlier log backup that includes LSN %.*ls can be restored.
4307,16,The online restore to database '%ls' failed. It may be appropriate to perform an offline restore instead. To force an offline restore, first take the database offline using the ALTER DATABASE statement.
4308,10,The online restore is complete, but WITH NORECOVERY was specified. Use RESTORE WITH RECOVERY to bring affected data online.
4309,16,The state of file "%ls" prevents restoring individual pages.  Only a file restore is currently possible.
4310,16,RESTORE PAGE is not allowed on file "%ls" because the file is not online.
4311,16,RESTORE PAGE is not allowed from backups taken with earlier versions of SQL Server.
4312,16,This log cannot be restored because a gap in the log chain was created. Use more recent data backups to bridge the gap.
4315,10,Some files still require more restore steps before the online restore sequence can be completed.
4318,16,File '%ls' has been rolled forward to LSN %.*ls. This log terminates at LSN %.*ls, which is too early to apply the WITH RECOVERY option. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement WITH NORECOVERY.
4319,16,A previous restore operation was interrupted and did not complete processing on file '%ls'. Either restore the backup set that was interrupted or restart the restore sequence.
4320,16,The file "%ls" was not fully restored by a database or file restore. The entire file must be successfully restored before applying this backup set.
4322,10,This backup set contains records that were logged before the designated point in time. The database is being left in the restoring state so that more roll forward can be performed.
4323,16,A previous RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR operation left the database in a potentially damaged state. To continue this RESTORE sequence, all further steps must include the CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR option.
4326,16,The log in this backup set terminates at LSN %.*ls, which is too early to apply to the database. A more recent log backup that includes LSN %.*ls can be restored.
4327,16,The log in this backup set contains bulk-logged changes. Point-in-time recovery was inhibited. The database has been rolled forward to the end of the log.
4328,16,The file "%ls" is missing. Roll forward stops at log sequence number %.*ls. The file is created at log sequence number (LSN) %.*ls, dropped at LSN %.*ls. Restore the transaction log beyond the point in time when the file was dropped, or restore data to be consistent with rest of the database.
4329,10,This log file contains records logged before the designated mark. The database is being left in the Restoring state so you can apply another log file.
4330,16,This backup set cannot be applied because it is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with the database. The recovery path is the sequence of data and log backups that have brought the database to a particular recovery point. Find a compatible backup to restore, or restore the rest of the database to match a recovery point within this backup set, which will restore the database to a different point in time.  For more information about recovery paths, see SQL Server Books Online.
4331,16,The database cannot be recovered because the files have been restored to inconsistent points in time.
4332,16,RESTORE LOG has been halted. To use the database in its current state, run RESTORE DATABASE %ls WITH RECOVERY.
4333,16,The database cannot be recovered because the log was not restored.
4334,16,The named mark does not identify a valid LSN.
4335,16,The specified STOPAT time is too early. All or part of the database is already rolled forward beyond that point.
4336,16,The filegroup "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database.
4337,16,The file "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database.
4338,16,The STOPAT clause specifies a point too early to allow this backup set to be restored. Choose a different stop point or use RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY to recover at the current point.
4339,10,This RESTORE statement successfully performed some actions, but the database could not be brought online because one or more RESTORE steps are needed. Previous messages indicate reasons why recovery cannot occur at this point.
4340,16,The point-in-time clause of this RESTORE statement is restricted for use by RESTORE LOG statements only. Omit the clause or use a clause that includes a timestamp.
4341,16,This log backup contains bulk-logged changes. It cannot be used to stop at an arbitrary point in time.
4342,16,Point-in-time recovery is not possible unless the primary filegroup is part of the restore sequence. Omit the point-in-time clause or restore the primary filegroup.
4343,16,The database has been rolled forward to the end of this backup set and beyond the specified point in time. RESTORE WITH RECOVERY can be used to accept the current recovery point.
4344,16,RESTORE PAGE is not allowed on read-only databases or filegroups.
4345,10,Problems recording information in the msdb..suspect_pages table were encountered. This error does not interfere with any activity except maintenance of the suspect_pages table. Check the error log for more information.
4346,16,RESTORE PAGE is not allowed with databases that use the simple recovery model or have broken the log backup chain.
4347,16,The current restore sequence was previously interrupted during the transition to the online state. RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY can be used to complete the transition to online.
4348,16,The online restore to database '%ls' failed. It may be appropriate to perform an offline restore instead. An offline restore is initiated by using BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY.
4349,16,The log in this backup set begins at LSN %.*ls, which is too recent to apply to the database. This restore sequence needs to initialize the log to start at LSN %.*ls. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement using an earlier log backup.
4350,16,The list of pages provided with the RESTORE PAGE statement is incorrectly formatted. Prior to the problem %d pages were correctly identified. The problem was hit at character offset %d. Check that all pages are identified by numeric <file>:<page> pairs with commas separating each pair.  For example: PAGE='1:57,2:31'.
4351,16,Backups taken on earlier versions of SQL Server are not supported by fn_dump_dblog.
4352,16,RESTORE LOG is not supported from this data backup because file '%ls' is too old. Use a regular log backup to continue the restore sequence.
4353,16,Conflicting file relocations have been specified for file '%.*ls'. Only a single WITH MOVE clause should be specified for any logical file name.
4354,10,The file '%.*ls' of restored database '%ls' is being left in the defunct state because the database is being upgraded from a prior version. Piecemeal restore is not supported when an upgrade is involved.
4355,16,The revert command is incorrectly specified. The RESTORE statement must be of the form: RESTORE DATABASE <x> FROM DATABASE_SNAPSHOT = <y>.
4356,10,Restore is complete on database '%ls'.  The database is now available.
4357,16,Restore cannot take '%ls' offline because changes exist that require a log backup. Take a log backup and then retry the RESTORE.
4358,16,The database can not be brought online because file '%ls' is currently restored to LSN %.*ls but must be restored to LSN %.*ls.
4359,16,The STOPAT option cannot be used with this partial restore sequence because one or more FILESTREAM filegroups are not included. The CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR option can be used to force the recovery, but this should only be used if you do not intend to subsequently restore the FILESTREAM filegroups.
4360,16,RESTORE LOG WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR was unsuccessful. Execution of the RESTORE command was aborted.
4361,16,Redo LSN has not changed for a while. Abandoning the wait as this could be a deadlock. Redo LSN %.*ls, HkRecoveryLsn %.*ls.
4403,16,Cannot update the view or function '%.*ls' because it contains aggregates, or a DISTINCT or GROUP BY clause, or PIVOT or UNPIVOT operator.
4405,16,View or function '%.*ls' is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.
4406,16,Update or insert of view or function '%.*ls' failed because it contains a derived or constant field.
4408,19,Too many tables. The query and the views or functions in it exceed the limit of %d tables. Revise the query to reduce the number of tables.
4413,16,Could not use view or function '%.*ls' because of binding errors.
4414,16,Could not allocate ancillary table for view or function resolution. The maximum number of tables in a query (%d) was exceeded.
4415,16,View '%.*ls' is not updatable because either it was created WITH CHECK OPTION or it spans a view created WITH CHECK OPTION and the target table is referenced multiple times in the resulting query.
4416,16,UNION ALL view '%.*ls' is not updatable because the definition contains a disallowed construct.
4417,16,Derived table '%.*ls' is not updatable because the definition contains a UNION operator.
4418,16,Derived table '%.*ls' is not updatable because it contains aggregates, or a DISTINCT or GROUP BY clause, or PIVOT or UNPIVOT operator.
4420,16,Derived table '%.*ls' is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.
4421,16,Derived table '%.*ls' is not updatable because a column of the derived table is derived or constant.
4422,16,View '%.*ls' has an INSTEAD OF UPDATE trigger and cannot be a target of an UPDATE FROM statement.
4423,16,View '%.*ls' has an INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger and cannot be a target of a DELETE FROM statement.
4424,16,Joined tables cannot be specified in a query containing outer join operators. View or function '%.*ls' contains joined tables.
4425,16,Cannot specify outer join operators in a query containing joined tables. View or function '%.*ls' contains outer join operators.
4426,16,View '%.*ls' is not updatable because the definition contains a UNION operator.
4427,16,Cannot update the view "%.*ls" because it or a view it references was created with WITH CHECK OPTION and its definition contains a TOP or OFFSET clause.
4429,16,View or function '%.*ls' contains a self-reference. Views or functions cannot reference themselves directly or indirectly.
4430,10,Warning: Index hints supplied for view '%.*ls' will be ignored.

8604,16,ALTER TABLE SWITCH statement failed. Table '%.*ls' has a column level check constraint '%.*ls' on column '%.*ls' that is not loadable for semantic validation.
8605,10,Index creation operation will use %ld KB of memory specified in the advanced sp_configure option "min memory per query (KB)" instead of %lu KB specified in "index create memory (KB)" option because the former has to be smaller than the latter.
8606,17,This index operation requires %I64d KB of memory per DOP. The total requirement of %I64d KB for DOP of %lu is greater than the sp_configure value of %lu KB set for the advanced server configuration option "index create memory (KB)".  Increase this setting or reduce DOP and rerun the query.
8607,16,The table '%.*ls' cannot be modified because one or more non-clustered indexes reside in a filegroup which is not online.
8608,16, The query could not be completed due to an online index build operation and must be recompiled.
8616,10,The index hints for table '%.*ls' were ignored because the table was considered a fact table in the star join.
8618,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan because a worktable is required, and its minimum row size exceeds the maximum allowable of %d bytes. A typical reason why a worktable is required is a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause in the query. If the query has a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause, consider reducing the number and/or size of the fields in the clause. Consider using prefix (LEFT()) or hash (CHECKSUM()) of fields for grouping or prefix for ordering. Note however that this will change the behavior of the query.
8619,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan because a worktable is required, and its minimum row size exceeds the maximum allowable of %d bytes. A typical reason why a worktable is required is a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause in the query. Resubmit your query without the ROBUST PLAN hint.
8621,16,The query processor ran out of stack space during query optimization. Please simplify the query.
8622,16,Query processor could not produce a query plan because of the hints defined in this query. Resubmit the query without specifying any hints and without using SET FORCEPLAN.
8623,16,The query processor ran out of internal resources and could not produce a query plan. This is a rare event and only expected for extremely complex queries or queries that reference a very large number of tables or partitions. Please simplify the query. If you believe you have received this message in error, contact Customer Support Services for more information.
8624,16,Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor could not produce a query plan. For more information, contact Customer Support Services.
8625,10,Warning: The join order has been enforced because a local join hint is used.
8628,17,A time out occurred while waiting to optimize the query. Rerun the query.
8630,17,Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor encountered an unexpected error during execution (HRESULT = 0x%x).
8631,17,Internal error: Server stack limit has been reached. Please look for potentially deep nesting in your query, and try to simplify it.
8632,17,Internal error: An expression services limit has been reached. Please look for potentially complex expressions in your query, and try to simplify them.
8633,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan because distributed query does not support materializing intermediate results with default in DML queries over remote sources. Try to use actual default values instead of default or split the update into multiple statements, one only containing the DEFAULT assignment, the other with the rest.
8634,17,The query processor received an error from a cluster communication layer.
8635,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan for a query with a spatial index hint.  Reason: %S_MSG.  Try removing the index hints or removing SET FORCEPLAN.
8636,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan because there is a subquery in the predicate of the full outer join. This is not supported for distributed queries.
8637,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan because a USE PLAN hint was used for a query that modifies data while the target table of the modification has an index that is currently being built online. Consider waiting until the online index build is done before forcing the plan, or using another way to tune the query, such as updating statistics, or using a different hint or a manual query rewrite.
8638,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan because CURSOR fetch queries cannot reference external tables. Ensure that the input request does not contain remote UPDATE or DELETE on external tables.
8642,17,The query processor could not start the necessary thread resources for parallel query execution. Reduce load on the server or use the MAXDOP setting to limit parallelism.
8644,16,Internal Query Processor Error: The plan selected for execution does not support the invoked given execution routine.
8645,17,A timeout occurred while waiting for memory resources to execute the query in resource pool '%ls' (%ld). Rerun the query.
8646,21,Unable to find index entry in index ID %d, of table %d, in database '%.*ls'. The indicated index is corrupt or there is a problem with the current update plan. Run DBCC CHECKDB or DBCC CHECKTABLE. If the problem persists, contact product support.
8648,20,Could not insert a row larger than the page size into a hash table. Resubmit the query using the ROBUST PLAN optimization hint.
8649,17,The query has been canceled because the estimated cost of this query (%d) exceeds the configured threshold of %d. Contact the system administrator.
8651,17,Could not perform the operation because the requested memory grant was not available in resource pool '%ls' (%ld).  Rerun the query, reduce the query load, or check resource governor configuration setting.
8653,16,The query processor is unable to produce a plan for the table or view '%.*ls' because the table resides in a filegroup that is not online.
8655,16,The query processor is unable to produce a plan because the index '%.*ls' on table or view '%.*ls' is disabled.
8656,16,The query processor could not produce a query plan. Resubmit the query after disabling trace flag %d.
8657,17,Could not get the memory grant of %I64d KB because it exceeds the maximum configuration limit in workload group '%ls' (%ld) and resource pool '%ls' (%ld).  Contact the server administrator to increase the memory usage limit.
8658,17,Cannot start the columnstore index build because it requires at least %I64d KB, while the maximum memory grant is limited to %I64d KB per query in workload group '%ls' (%ld) and resource pool '%ls' (%ld). Retry after modifying columnstore index to contain fewer columns, or after increasing the maximum memory grant limit with Resource Governor.
8659,17,Cannot continue columnstore index build because it requires %I64d KB misc memory per thread, while the total memory grant for query is %I64d KB, total Columnstore bulk insert memory is limited to %I64d KB in query, and the maximum memory grant is limited to %I64d KB per query in workload group id=%ld and resource pool id=%ld. Retry after modifying columnstore index to contain fewer columns, or after increasing the maximum memory grant limit with Resource Governor.
8660,16,Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the select list of the view definition does not include all columns in the GROUP BY clause. Consider adding these columns to the select list.
8661,16,Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the index key includes columns that are not in the GROUP BY clause. Consider eliminating columns that are not in the GROUP BY clause from the index key.
8662,16,Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the view references an unknown value (SUM aggregate of nullable expression). Consider referencing only non-nullable values in SUM. ISNULL() may be useful for this.
8663,16,Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because its select list does not include COUNT_BIG(*). Consider adding COUNT_BIG(*) to the select list.
8665,16,Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because no row can satisfy the view definition. Consider eliminating contradictions from the view definition.
8668,16,Cannot create the clustered index '%.*ls' on view '%.*ls' because the select list of the view contains an expression on result of aggregate function or grouping column. Consider removing expression on result of aggregate function or grouping column from select list.
8669,16,The attempt to maintain the indexed view "%.*ls" failed because it contains an expression on aggregate results, or because it contains a ranking or aggregate window function. Consider dropping the clustered index on the view, or changing the view definition.
8670,16,Query optimizer reached the internal limit of the maximum number of views that can be used during optimization.
8671,16,The attempt to maintain the indexed view "%.*ls" failed because of the ignore_dup_key option on index "%.*ls". Drop the index or re-create it without the ignore_dup_key index option.
8672,16,The MERGE statement attempted to UPDATE or DELETE the same row more than once. This happens when a target row matches more than one source row. A MERGE statement cannot UPDATE/DELETE the same row of the target table multiple times. Refine the ON clause to ensure a target row matches at most one source row, or use the GROUP BY clause to group the source rows.
8673,16,A MERGE statement is not valid if it triggers both the 'ON DELETE SET NULL' and 'ON UPDATE CASCADE' actions for a referential integrity constraint. Modify the actions performed by the MERGE statement to ensure that it does not trigger both these actions for a referential integrity constraint.
8674,16,The query processor is unable to produce a plan. The table '%.*ls' is unavailable because the heap is corrupted. Take the database offline to rebuild the table and heap, and then run the query processor again.
8675,16,Cannot run query because internal optimization replay failed.
8676,16,Invalid plan.
8677,16,Cannot create the clustered index '%.*ls' on view '%.*ls' because it does not aggregate results. Consider changing the view definition.
8678,16,Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the view references a SUM aggregate of a nullable expression. Consider adding a new COUNT_BIG aggregate over such nullable expression.
8679,16,The UPDATE/DELETE statement attempted to modify the same row more than once. Refine the statement to ensure a target row is modified at most once.
8680,17,Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor encountered an unexpected error during the processing of a remote query phase.
8681,17,Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor encountered an unexpected error during processing. [%ls]
8682,16,SELECT via cursor failed because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN hint, neither Populate nor Fetch plans are provided, and at least one must be present. For best likelihood of successful plan forcing, use an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification.
8683,16,Could not force query plan because XML showplan provided in USE PLAN hint contains invalid Star Join specification. Consider specifying a USE PLAN hint that contains an unmodified XML showplan produced by SQL Server. This may allow you to force the plan.
8684,16,A query plan could not be found because optimizer exceeded number of allowed operations while searching for plan specified in USE PLAN hint. First consider removing USE PLAN hint. Then if necessary consider (1) updating statistics, (2) using other hints such as join hints, index hints, or the OPTIMIZE FOR hint, (3) rewriting query or breaking it down into two or more separate queries.
8685,16,Query cannot be compiled because <CursorStmt> element appears in XML plan provided to USE PLAN but USE PLAN was applied to a non-cursor statement. Consider using an XML plan obtained from SQL Server for statement without modification.
8686,16,Cursor plan forcing failed because input plan has more than one <Operation> node with OperationType=%ls. Consider using an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification.
8687,16,Cursor plan failed because it is not possible to force the plan for a cursor of type other than FAST_FORWARD or STATIC with a USE PLAN hint. Consider removing USE PLAN hint and updating statistics or using different hints to influence query plan choice.
8688,16,Cursor plan forcing failed because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN, required element %ls is missing under <CursorPlan> element. Consider using an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification.
8689,16,Database '%.*ls', specified in the USE PLAN hint, does not exist. Specify an existing database.
8690,16,Query cannot be compiled because USE PLAN hint conflicts with hint %ls. Consider removing hint %ls.
8691,16,Query cannot be compiled because USE PLAN hint conflicts with SET %ls ON. Consider setting %ls OFF.
8693,16,Cannot compile query because combination of LogicalOp = '%ls', PhysicalOp = '%ls', and sub_element = '%ls' under RelOp element in XML plan in USE PLAN hint is not valid. Use a recognized combination instead. Consider using an automatically generated XML plan without modification.
8694,16,Cannot execute query because USE PLAN hint conflicts with use of distributed query or full-text operations. Consider removing USE PLAN hint.
8695,16,Cannot execute query because of incorrectly formed XML plan in USE PLAN hint. Verify that XML plan is a legal plan suitable for plan forcing. See Books Online for additional details.
8696,16,Cannot run query because of improperly formed Spool element with parent RelOp with NodeId %d in XML plan in USE PLAN hint. Verify that each Spool element's parent RelOp has unique NodeId attribute, and each Spool element has either a single RelOp sub-element, or a PrimaryNodeId attribute, but not both. PrimaryNodeId of Spool must reference NodeId of an existing RelOp with a Spool sub-element. Consider using unmodified XML showplan as USE PLAN hint.
8697,16,Cannot run query because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN, element %ls must have %d %ls nodes as children, but has %d.
8698,16,Query processor could not produce query plan because USE PLAN hint contains plan that could not be verified to be legal for query. Remove or replace USE PLAN hint. For best likelihood of successful plan forcing, verify that the plan provided in the USE PLAN hint is one generated automatically by SQL Server for the same query.
8699,16,Cannot run query because it contains more than one USE PLAN hint. Use at most one USE PLAN hint.
8700,16,Query could not run because column store indexes on memory optimized tables are currently disabled.  Rewrite the query with an index hint specifying a different index.
8705,16,A DML statement encountered a missing entry in index ID %d of table ID %d, in the database '%.*ls' due to an interaction with another transaction. If you continue to see this error, consider using Repeatable Read or higher isolation level.
8709,16,Error due to negative or NULL window delimiter.
8710,16,Aggregate functions that are used with CUBE, ROLLUP, or GROUPING SET queries must provide for the merging of subaggregates. To fix this problem, remove the aggregate function or write the query using UNION ALL over GROUP BY clauses.
8711,16,Multiple ordered aggregate functions in the same scope have mutually incompatible orderings.
8712,16,Index '%.*ls', specified in the USE PLAN hint, does not exist. Specify an existing index, or create an index with the specified name.
8713,16,Could not force query plan because of a problem in an indexed view referenced in the plan.
8714,16,Polybase Error: Failed to convert external data format to SQL Server internal format.
8715,16,Polybase Error: Failed to set physical layout for table given an external buffer layout.
8716,16,Invalid data was detected. An external producer has inserted a value into shared memory table that is not supported by SQL Server.
8717,16,DML Operations are not supported with external tables.
8720,15,Cannot execute query. There is more than one TABLE HINT clause specified for object '%.*ls'. Use at most one such TABLE HINT clause per table reference.
8721,15,Cannot execute query. TABLE HINT in the OPTION clause leads to ambiguous reference for object '%.*ls'. Consider USE PLAN query hint instead.
8722,15,Cannot execute query. Semantic affecting hint '%.*ls' appears in the '%.*ls' clause of object '%.*ls' but not in the corresponding '%.*ls' clause.  Change the OPTION (TABLE HINTS...) clause so the semantic affecting hints match the WITH clause.
8723,15,Cannot execute query. Object '%.*ls' is specified in the TABLE HINT clause, but is not used in the query or does not match the alias specified in the query. Table references in the TABLE HINT clause must match the WITH clause.
8724,15,Cannot execute query. Table-valued or OPENROWSET function '%.*ls' cannot be specified in the TABLE HINT clause.
8725,17,Subproc thread aborted during parallel query execution.
8726,16,Input parameter of %.*ls function must be a constant.
8727,16,Input parameter of percentile function is outside of range [0, 1].
8728,16,ORDER BY list of RANGE window frame cannot contain expressions of LOB type.

12800,16,The reference to temp table name '%.*ls' is ambiguous and cannot be resolved. Use either '%.*ls' or '%.*ls'.
12801,16,The reference to cursor name '%.*ls' is ambiguous and cannot be resolved. Possible candidates are '%.*ls' and '%.*ls'.
12803,16,Containment cannot be enabled for database '%.*ls' because it is a system database.
12804,16,Feature or option "%ls" breaches containment in a contained database. Please see Books Online topic Understanding Contained Databases for more information on contained databases.
12805,16,Index name '%.*ls' is too long. Maximum length for temp table index name is %d characters.
12807,16,The option '%.*ls' cannot be set on non-contained database.
12808,16,The option '%.*ls' cannot be set on a database while containment is being set to NONE.
12809,16,You must remove all users with password before setting the containment property to NONE.
12810,16,The option '%.*ls' was specified multiple times.
12811,16,The user options for the instance must be set to 0 in order to %S_MSG a contained database.
12813,16,Errors were encountered in the %S_MSG '%.*ls' during compilation of the object. Either the containment option of the database '%.*ls' was changed, or this object was present in model db and the user tried to create a new contained database.
12814,16,The object referenced as '%.*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.*ls'.
12815,16,The column referenced as '%.*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.*ls'.
12816,16,The type or XML schema collection referenced as '%.*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.*ls'.
12817,16,The reference to the variable, parameter or goto label '%.*ls' resolves differently in the target metadata collation '%.*ls' than in the current metadata collation '%.*ls'.
12818,16,RECONFIGURE failed. Attempting to change the 'contained database authentication' value to 0 while there are existing contained databases requires a RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE.
12819,16,sp_migrate_user_to_contained cannot be used in a non-contained database (a database with CONTAINMENT set to NONE).
12820,16,sp_migrate_user_to_contained can not be used with a user with a password or a user type other than SQL Login.
12821,16,sp_migrate_user_to_contained cannot be used on a user used in the EXECUTE AS clause of a signed module.
12822,16,sp_migrate_user_to_contained cannot be used to copy a password to an old hash algorithm.
12823,16,sp_migrate_user_to_contained can not find the login for user '%.*ls'.
12824,16,The sp_configure value 'contained database authentication' must be set to 1 in order to %S_MSG a contained database.  You may need to use RECONFIGURE to set the value_in_use.
12826,16,RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE set the 'contained database authentication' to 0 while there are contained databases in use. This will disrupt authentication for contained users and will not allow new contained databases to be created.
12827,16,User-named %ls constraint '%.*ls' is not allowed on temp table '%.*ls' because it is being created in a contained database. Please consult the Books Online topic Understanding Contained Databases for more information on contained databases.
12828,16,User-defined %S_MSG '%.*ls' in tempdb cannot be referenced from local temp table '%.*ls' because the temp table is being created in a contained database. Please consult the Books Online topic Understanding Contained Databases for more information on contained databases.
12829,16,The stored procedure '%.*ls' refers to a group of numbered stored procedures. Numbered stored procedures are not available in contained databases. Please consult the Books Online topic Understanding Contained Databases for more information on contained databases.
12830,16,The sp_configure 'user options' setting must be zero if the Database Engine has contained databases.
12831,16,Database '%.*ls' is a contained database. The option 'contained database authentication' setting is 0.  Users with passwords will not be able to login to contained databases.
12832,16,The database '%.*ls' could not be created or altered to a contained database, because the schema bound %S_MSG '%.*ls' depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database.
12833,16,The database '%.*ls' could not be created or altered to a contained database, because the check constraint '%.*ls' on table '%.*ls' depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database.
12834,16,The database '%.*ls' could not be created or altered to a contained database, because the computed column '%.*ls' on %S_MSG '%.*ls' depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database.
12835,10,The definition of the %S_MSG '%.*ls' was refreshed as part of altering the containment option of the database '%.*ls' because the object depends on builtin function '%s'. In a contained database, the output collation of this builtin function has changed to '%.*ls', which differs from the collation used in a non-contained database.
12836,16,ALTER DATABASE statement failed. The containment option of the database '%.*ls' could not be altered because compilation errors were encountered during validation of SQL modules. See previous errors.
12837,16,CREATE DATABASE statement failed. The contained database '%.*ls' could not be created because compilation errors were encountered during validation of SQL modules. See previous errors.
12838,16,Replication, Change Data Capture and Change Tracking are not supported in contained databases. The database '%.*ls' cannot be altered to a contained database, since it has one of these options turned on.
12839,16,Replication, Change Data Capture, Change Feed and Change Tracking are not supported in contained databases. The option cannot be enabled on the contained database '%s'.
12840,16,CREATE DATABASE failed. Recollating the database failed while creating the partially contained database '%.*ls', with a default data collation of '%.*ls'.
12841,16,ALTER DATABASE failed. Recollating the database failed while altering the database '%.*ls' to containment='%ls'.
12842,16,The COLLATE CATALOG_DEFAULT clause cannot be used in a constraint, computed column, index filter expression, or any schema-bound object.
12843,16,The containment state of database '%.*ls' does not match the value in master. Contained database functionality will not work as expected. Detach and re-attach the database to correct the database state in master.
12844,16,ALTER DATABASE statement failed; this functionality is not available in the current edition of SQL Server.
12845,16,CREATE DATABASE statement failed; cannot specify both CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL and CATALOG_COLLATION.
12846,16,Change Feed is not supported in contained databases. The database '%.*ls' cannot be altered to a contained database, since Change Feed has been enabled.

20669,16,Object referenced by the given @article or @artid '%s' could not be found.
20670,16,Cannot add, drop, or alter the identity range check constraint for table %s. This constraint is used by replication for automatic identity range management. This error typically occurs if the user who made the last insert in the table does not have permission to make schema changes on the table. If this error occurs at the Publisher, run sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange; if it occurs at the Subscriber, run the Merge Agent.
20671,16,Cannot find the identity range allocation entry for the Subscriber in the MSmerge_identity_range table. Reinitialize the subscription.
20672,16,A value for the parameter @host_name was specified, but no articles in the publication use HOST_NAME() for parameterized filtering.

20674,16,The publication does not use dynamic filtering.
20675,16,The identity range values cannot be NULL.
20676,11,Cannot refresh the Publisher identity range for article "%s". Execute the stored procedure sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange to refresh the identity range.
20677,11,Cannot add article "%s" with automatic identity range management. The article is already published in a transactional publication with automatic identity range management.
20678,11,Could not find the regular snapshot job for the specified publication '%s'.
20679,11,Cannot execute the stored procedure sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange on the current database because the database is a republisher or a Subscriber. To adjust the identity range at a republisher or a Subscriber, synchronize with the root Publisher.
20680,16,Failed to get metadata for a batch of rows.
20681,10,Cannot specify a value of 1, 2, or 3 for the parameter @partition_options because publication "%s" has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use the stored procedure sp_changemergepublication to set publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.

20692,16,One or more rows to be inserted in the batch insert procedure for table %s were present in MSmerge_tombstone; merge replication cannot use batch insert. This typically occurs when rows move from one partition to another. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, verify that data is partitioned optimally. Batch insert can improve the performance of merge replication.
20693,16,One or more rows to be inserted in the batch insert procedure for table %s were present in MSmerge_contents; merge replication cannot use batch insert. This typically occurs when rows move from one partition to another. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, verify that data is partitioned optimally. Batch insert can improve the performance of merge replication.
20694,16,One or more rows to be updated for table %s contain changes in the column %s, which is used in one or more filters; merge replication cannot use batch processing for these changes. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, verify that data is partitioned optimally. Batch updates can improve the performance of merge replication.
20695,16,Only %ld out of %ld rows were updated in the batched update procedure for table %s; other rows could not be updated because they have been deleted. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, determine if update-delete conflicts can be avoided. Batch updates can be helpful for performance.
20696,16,The object %s is marked as shipped by Microsoft (ms_shipped). It cannot be added as an article for merge replication.
20697,16,Cannot drop article %s from publication %s. In this publication, this is the only article that uses a parameterized filter.

21569,16,The article %s in the publication %s does not have a valid conflict table entry in the system table sysarticleupdates. This entry is required for publications that allow queued updating subscriptions. Check for errors in the last run of the Snapshot Agent.
21570,16,Cannot create the logical record relationship. Table '%s' does not have a foreign key referencing table '%s'. A logical record relationship requires a foreign key relationship between the parent and child tables.
21571,16,Cannot create the logical record relationship in publication '%s'. The use_partition_groups option for the publication must be set to "true" in order to use logical records. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the option to "true".
21572,16,Cannot add a logical record relationship because the foreign key constraint '%s' on table '%s' is disabled. To create the logical record relationship, first enable the foreign key constraint.
21573,16,Cannot add a logical record relationship because the foreign key constraint '%s' on table '%s' is defined with the NOT FOR REPLICATION option. To add the logical record relationship, first drop the foreign key constraint, and then re-create it without the NOT FOR REPLICATION option.
21574,16,Cannot add a logical record relationship because the article '%s' is published in publication '%s', which has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.
21575,16,The value specified for the property filter_type is not valid. Valid values are 1 (join filter only), 2 (logical record relation only), and 3 (join filter and logical record relation).
21576,16,Cannot add a logical record relationship between tables '%s' and '%s' because the foreign key column '%s' in table '%s' allows NULL values. Alter the column to disallow NULL values.
21578,16,In order to use partition_options of 2 (non overlapping partitions with multiple subscriptions per partition) or 3 (non overlapping partitions one subscription per partition) the publication '%s' must be enabled to use partition groups functionality. Use sp_changemergepublication to set 'use_partition_groups' to 'true'.
21579,16,Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of  2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article is involved in multiple join filters. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter, or drop all but one of the join filters by using sp_dropmergefilter.
21580,16,Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified.

21581,16,Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of  2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article has a join filter with a join_unique_key value of 0. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter, or use sp_changemergefilter to specify a value of 1 for join_unique_key.
21582,16,Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of  2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article has a direct or indirect join filter relationship with parent article "%s". The parent article does not use the same value for partition_options. Use sp_changemergepublication to change the value for one of the articles.
21583,16,Cannot update the column in article '%s'. The article has a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the partition_options property, and the column is involved in a row filter and/or a join filter. In this situation, the column cannot be updated at a Subscriber or republisher; it must be updated at the top-level Publisher.
21584,16,Cannot insert the row for article '%s'. The row does not belong to the Subscriber's partition, and the article has a value of 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the partition_options property. Nonoverlapping partitions do not allow out-of-partition inserts.
21585,16,Cannot specify custom article ordering in publication '%s' because the publication has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.

22585,10,The schema option to script out the FILESTREAM attribute on varbinary(max) columns has been enabled for article '%s'. Enabling this option after the article is created can cause replication to fail when the data in a FILESTREAM column exceeds 2GB and there is a conflict during replication. If you want FILESTREAM data to be replicated, drop and re-create the article, and specify the appropriate schema option when you re-create the article.
22586,16,Column '%s' cannot be added or modified in article '%s' of publication '%s'. The DDL operatoin on hierarchyid and FILESTREAM columns is not supported for publications that have a 'sync_mode' of 1 (character mode) or with a lower than 90RTM backward compatibility level.

30009,16,The argument data type '%ls' specified for the full-text query is not valid. Allowed data types are char, varchar, nchar, nvarchar.
30020,16,The full-text query parameter for %S_MSG is not valid.
30022,10,Warning: The configuration of a full-text stoplist was modified using the WITH NO POPULATION clause. This put the full-text index into an inconsistent state. To bring the full-text index into a consistent state, start a full population. The basic Transact-SQL syntax for this is: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON table_name START FULL POPULATION.
30023,16,The fulltext stoplist '%.*ls' does not exist or the current user does not have permission to perform this action. Verify that the correct stoplist name is specified and that the user had the permission required by the Transact-SQL statement.
30024,16,The fulltext stoplist '%.*ls' already exists in the current database. Duplicate stoplist names are not allowed. Rerun the statement and specify a unique stoplist name.
30025,16,The search property list '%.*ls' does not exist or you do not have permission to perform this action. Verify that the correct search property list name is specified and that you have the permission required by the Transact-SQL statement. For a list of the search property lists on the current database, use the sys.registered_search_property_lists catalog view. For information about permissions required by a Transact-SQL statement, see the Transact-SQL reference topic for the statement in SQL Server Books Online.
30026,16,The search property list '%.*ls' already exists in the current database. Duplicate search property list names are not allowed. Rerun the statement and specify a unique name for the search property list. For a list of the search property lists on the current database, use the sys.registered_search_property_lists catalog view.
30027,10,The full-text index is in an inconsistent state because the search property list of the full-text index was reconfigured using the WITH NO POPULATION clause. To bring the full-text index into a consistent state, start a full population using the statement ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON <table_name> START FULL POPULATION;. This is a warning. No user action is necessary.

For information about the permissions required by a Transact-SQL statement, see the Transact-SQL reference topic for the statement in SQL Server Books Online.
30031,17,A full-text master merge failed on full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%.*ls' with error 0x%08X.
30032,16,The stoplist '%.*ls' does not contain fulltext stopword '%.*ls' with locale ID %d. Specify a valid stopword and locale identifier (LCID) in the Transact-SQL statement.
30033,16,The stoplist '%.*ls' already contains full-text stopword '%.*ls' with locale ID %d. Specify a unique stopword and locale identifier (LCID) in the Transact-SQL statement.
30034,16,Full-text stoplist '%.*ls' cannot be dropped because it is being used by at least one full-text index. To identify which full-text index is using a stoplist: obtain the stoplist ID from the stoplist_id column of the sys.fulltext_indexes catalog view, and then look up that stoplist ID in the stoplist_id column of the sys.fulltext_stoplists catalog view. Either drop the full-text index by using DROP FULLTEXT INDEX or change its stoplist setting by using ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX. Then retry dropping the stoplist.
30035,16,The search property '%.*ls' already exists in the search property list. Specify a search property name that is unique within the specified search property list. For a list of the search properties on the current database, use the sys.registered_search_properties catalog view.
30036,16,Search property list '%.*ls' cannot be dropped because it is being used by at least one full-text index. To identify the full-text indexes that are using the search property list, obtain the search property list id from the property_list_id column of the sys.registered_search_property_lists catalog view, and then obtain the object ID of every table or indexed view whose full-text index is associated with this search property list from the object_id and property_list_id columns of the sys.fulltext_indexes catalog view . For each full-text index, either remove the search property list or drop the full-text index, if it is no longer needed. To remove the search property list, use ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON <table_name> SET SEARCH PROPERTY LIST OFF;. To drop a full-text index, use DROP FULLTEXT INDEX ON <table_name>;.
30037,16,An argument passed to a fulltext function is not valid.
30038,17,Fulltext index error during compression or decompression. Full-text index may be corrupted on disk. Run dbcc checkdatabase and re-populate the index.
30039,17,Data coming back to the SQL Server process from the filter daemon host is corrupted. This may be caused by a bad filter. The batch for the indexing operation will automatically be retried using a smaller batch size.
30040,10,During a full-text crawl of table or indexed view '%ls', an unregistered property, '%ls', was found in batch ID %d. This property will be indexed as part of the generic content and will be unavailable for property-scoped full-text queries. Table or indexed view ID is '%d'. Database ID is '%d'. For information about registering properties and updating the full-text index of a table or indexed view, see the full-text search documentation in SQL Server Books Online. This is an informational message. No user action is necessary.
30041,10,The master merge started at the end of the full crawl of table or indexed view '%ls' failed with HRESULT = '0x%08x'. Database ID is '%d', table id is %d, catalog ID: %d.
30043,16,Stopwords of zero length cannot be added to a full-text stoplist. Specify a unique stopword that contains at least one character.
30044,16,The user does not have permission to alter the current default stoplist '%.*ls'. To change the default stoplist of the database, ALTER permission is required on both new and old default stoplists.
30045,17,Fulltext index error during compression or decompression. Full-text index may be corrupted on disk. Run dbcc checkdatabase and re-populate the index.
30046,16,SQL Server encountered error 0x%x while communicating with full-text filter daemon host (FDHost) process. Make sure that the FDHost process is running. To re-start the FDHost process, run the sp_fulltext_service 'restart_all_fdhosts' command or restart the SQL Server instance.
30047,16,The user does not have permission to %.*ls stoplist '%.*ls'.
30048,10,Informational: Ignoring duplicate thesaurus rule '%ls' while loading thesaurus file for LCID %d. A duplicate thesaurus phrase was encountered in either the <sub> section of an expansion rule or the <pat> section of a replacement rule. This causes an ambiguity and hence this phrase will be ignored.
30049,17,Fulltext thesaurus internal error (HRESULT = '0x%08x')
30050,16,Both the thesaurus file for lcid '%d' and the global thesaurus could not be loaded.
30051,16,Phrases longer than 512 unicode characters are not allowed in a thesaurus file. Phrase: '%ls'.
30052,16,The full-text query has a very complex NEAR clause in the CONTAINS predicate or CONTAINSTABLE function. To ensure that a NEAR clause runs successfully, use only six or fewer terms. Modify the query to simplify the condition by removing prefixes or repeated terms.
30053,16,An error has occurred during the full-text query. Common causes include: word-breaking errors or timeout, FDHOST permissions/ACL issues, service account missing privileges, malfunctioning IFilters, communication channel issues with FDHost and sqlservr.exe, etc.
30055,10,Full-text catalog import has started for full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls'.
30056,10,Full-text catalog import has finished for full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls'. %d fragments and %d keywords were processed.
30057,10,Upgrade option '%ls' is being used for full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls'.
30058,16,Properties of zero length cannot be added to a search property list. Specify a search property name that contains at least one character and that is unique to the specified search property list. For a list of the search properties on the current database, use the sys.registered_search_properties catalog view.
30059,16,A fatal error occurred during a full-text population and caused the population to be cancelled. Population type is: %s; database name is %s (id: %d); catalog name is %s (id: %d); table name %s (id: %d). Fix the errors that are logged in the full-text crawl log. Then, resume the population. The basic Transact-SQL syntax for this is: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON table_name RESUME POPULATION.
30060,16,The import population for database %ls (id: %d), catalog %ls (id: %d) is being cancelled because of a fatal error ('%ls'). Fix the errors that are logged in the full-text crawl log. Then resume the import either by detaching the database and re-attaching it, or by taking the database offline and bringing it back online. If the error is not recoverable, rebuild the full-text catalog.
30061,17,The SQL Server failed to create full-text filterdata directory. This might be because FulltextDefaultPath is invalid or SQL Server service account does not have permission. Full-text blob indexing will fail until this issue is resolved. Restart SQL Server after the issue is fixed.
30062,17,The SQL Server failed to load FDHost service group sid. This might be because installation is corrupted.
30063,10,Warning: SQL Server could not set fdhost.exe processor affinity to %d because the value is not valid.
30064,17,SQL Server failed to set security information on the full-text FilterData directory in the FTData folder. Full-text indexing of some types of documents may fail until this issue is resolved. You will need to repair the SQL Server installation.
30065,10,Filegroup '%ls' is offline, readonly, or no data file. Full-text population on table '%ls' is not resumed. Resume full-text population after fixing the filegroup status.
30067,10,Warning: The detach operation cannot delete a full-text index created on table '%ls' in database '%ls' because the index is on a read-only filegroup. To drop the full-text index, re-attach the database, change the read-only filegroup to read/write access and then detach it. This warning will not fail the database detach operation.
30068,10,During the database upgrade, the full-text filter component '%ls' that is used by catalog '%ls' was successfully verified. Component version is '%ls'; Full path is '%.*ls'.
30069,11,The full-text filter component '%ls' used to populate catalog '%ls' in a previous SQL Server release is not the current version (component version is '%ls', full path is '%.*ls'). This may cause search results to differ slightly from previous releases. To avoid this, rebuild the full-text catalog using the current version of the filter component.
30070,10,During the database upgrade, the full-text word-breaker component '%ls' that is used by catalog '%ls' was successfully verified. Component version is '%ls'. Full path is '%.*ls'. Language requested is %d. Language used is %d.
30071,11,The full-text word-breaker component '%ls' used to populate catalog '%ls' in a previous SQL Server release is not the current version (component version is '%ls', full path is '%.*ls', language requested is %d, language used is %d). This may cause search results to differ slightly from previous releases. To avoid this, rebuild the full-text catalog using the current version of the word-breaker component.
30072,10,During the database upgrade, the full-text protocol handler component '%ls' that is used by catalog '%ls' was successfully verified. Component version is '%ls'. Full path is '%.*ls'. Program ID is '%.*ls'.
30073,11,The full-text protocol handler component '%ls' used to populate catalog '%ls' in a previous SQL Server release is not the current version (component version is '%ls', full path is '%.*ls', program ID is '%.*ls'). This may cause search results to differ slightly from previous releases. To avoid this, rebuild the full-text catalog using the current version of the protocol handler component.
30074,17,The master merge of full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%.*ls' was cancelled.
30075,10,Full-text crawls for database ID: %d, table ID: %d, catalog ID: %d will be stopped since the clustered index on the table has been altered or dropped. Crawl will need to re-start from the beginning.
30076,10,Full-text crawl forward progress information for database ID: %d, table ID: %d, catalog ID: %d has been reset due to the modification of the clustered index. Crawl will re-start from the beginning when it is unpaused.
30077,16,The full-text query did not use the value specified for the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint. Only single terms are allowed as values for full-text queries that contain an OPTIMIZE FOR query hint. Modify the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint value to be a single, non-empty term.
30078,10,The fulltext query did not use the value specified for the OPTIMIZE FOR hint because the query contained more than one type of full-text logical operator.
30079,10,The full text query ignored UNKNOWN in the OPTIMIZE FOR hint.
30080,16,The full-text population on table '%ls' cannot be started because the full-text catalog is importing data from existing catalogs. After the import operation finishes, rerun the command.
30081,10,A cached plan was compiled using trace flags that are incompatible with the current values. Consider recompiling the query with the new trace flag settings.
30082,16,Full-text predicates cannot appear in an aggregate expression. Place the aggregate expression in a subquery.
30083,16,Full-text predicates cannot appear in the GROUP BY clause. Place a GROUP BY clause expression in a subquery.
30084,16,The full-text index cannot be created because filegroup '%.*ls' does not exist or the filegroup name is incorrectly specified. Specify a valid filegroup name.
30085,16,A stoplist cache cannot be generated while processing a full-text query or performing full-text indexing. There is not enough memory to load the stoplist cache. Rerun the query or indexing command when more resources are available.
30086,16,The system ran out of memory while building a full-text index. The batch for the full-text indexing operation will automatically be retried using a smaller batch size.
30087,17,Data coming back to the SQL Server process from the filter daemon host is corrupted. This may be caused by a bad filter. The batch for the indexing operation will automatically be retried using a smaller batch size.
30088,10,The full-text filter daemon host process has stopped normally. The process will be automatically restarted if necessary.
30089,17,The fulltext filter daemon host (FDHost) process has stopped abnormally. This can occur if an incorrectly configured or malfunctioning linguistic component, such as a wordbreaker, stemmer or filter has caused an irrecoverable error during full-text indexing or query processing. The process will be restarted automatically.
30090,10,A new instance of the full-text filter daemon host process has been successfully started with version = %ls.
30091,10,A request to start a full-text index population on table or indexed view '%.*ls' is ignored because a population is currently paused. Either resume or stop the paused population. To resume it, use the following Transact-SQL statement: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON %.*ls RESUME POPULATION. To stop it, use the following statement: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON %.*ls STOP POPULATION.
30092,16,Full-text stoplist ID '%d' does not exist.
30093,17,The SQL Server word-breaking client failed to initialize. This might be because a filter daemon host process is not in a valid state. This can prevent SQL Server from initializing critical system objects. Full-text queries will fail until this issue is resolved. Try stopping SQL Server and any filter daemon host processes and then restarting the instance of SQL Server.
30094,17,The full-text indexing pipeline could not be initialized. This might be because the resources on the system are too low to allocate memory or create tasks. Try restarting the instance of SQL Server.
30095,10,The version of the language components used by full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls' is different from the version of the language components included this version of SQL Server. The full-text catalog will still be imported as part of database upgrade. To avoid any possible inconsistencies of query results, consider rebuilding the full-text catalog.
30096,10,A full-text retry pass of %ls population started for table or indexed view '%ls'. Table or indexed view ID is '%d'. Database ID is '%d'.
30097,10,The fulltext catalog upgrade failed because of an inconsistency in metadata between sys.master_files and sys.fulltext_catalogs for the catalog ID %d in database ID %d. Try to reattach this database. If this fails, then the catalog will need to be dropped or recreated before attach.
30098,10,An internal query to load data for a crawl on database '%.*ls' and table '%.*ls' failed with error code %d. Check the sql error code for more information about the condition causing this failure. The crawl needs to be restarted after this condition is removed.

31201,16,Property-scoped full-text queries cannot be specified on the specified table because its full-text index is not configured for property searching. To support property-scoped searches, the full-text index must be associated with a search property list and repopulated. The Transact-SQL syntax for this is: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON <table_name> SET SEARCH PROPERTY LIST <property_list_name>;.
31202,10,Reconfiguring the search property list of the full-text index has truncated the existing data in the index. Until the full-text index has been fully repopulated, full-text queries will return partial results. The ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX <table_name> SET SEARCH PROPERTY LIST ...; statement automatically issues a full population, but if the ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX statement specified the WITH NO POPULATION clause, you must run a full population on the full-text index using ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON <table_name> START FULL POPULATION;. This is a warning.

Connect to the server instance that hosts the primary database replica, and retry the operation.
33447,16,Cannot access file_stream column in FileTable '%.*ls', because FileTable doesn't support row versioning. Either set transaction level to something other than READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT or SNAPSHOT, or use READCOMMITTEDLOCK table hint.
33448,16,Cannot disable clustered index '%.*ls' on FileTable '%.*ls' because the FILETABLE_NAMESPACE is enabled.
33449,10,FILESTREAM File I/O access is enabled, but no listener for the availability group is created. A FILESTREAM PathName will be unable to refer to a virtual network name (VNN) and, instead, will need to refer to a physical Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) node. This might limit the usability of FILESTEAM File I/0 access after an availability group failover. Therefore, we recommend that you create a listener for each availability group. For information about how to create an availability group listener, see SQL Server Books Online.
33450,10,FILESTREAM File I/O access is enabled. One or more availability groups ('%ls') currently do not have a listener.  A FILESTREAM PathName will be unable to refer to a virtual network name (VNN) and, instead, will need to refer to a physical Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) node. This might limit the usability of FILESTEAM File I/0 access after an availability group failover. Therefore, we recommend that you create a listener for each availability group. For information about how to create an availability group listener, see SQL Server Books Online.
33451,16,Cannot enable Change Feed on the FileTable '%ls'. Change Feed is not supported for FileTable objects.
33501,16,Security predicates cannot be added on tables that contain filestream data. Column '%.*ls' on table '%.*ls' contains filestream data.
33502,16,The column '%.*ls' could not be added to table '%.*ls' because the column contains filestream data and the table is referenced by one or more security policies. Filestream columns are not allowed on tables that are referenced by security policies.
33503,16,BLOCK predicates can only be added to user tables. '%.*ls' is not a user table.
33504,16,The attempted operation failed because the target object '%.*ls' has a block predicate that conflicts with this operation. If the operation is performed on a view, the block predicate might be enforced on the underlying table. Modify the operation to target only the rows that are allowed by the block predicate.
33505,16,Partitioned view '%.*ls' is not updatable because table '%.*ls' has an enabled security policy that defines block predicates for this table.
33506,16,Only natively compiled inline table-valued functions can be used for security predicates on memory optimized tables. Table '%.*ls' is memory optimized, but function '%.*ls' is not natively compiled. Recreate the function using WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION.
33507,16,Function '%ls' cannot be used in the definition of BLOCK security predicates. Modify the BLOCK security predicates for this table or view to not use this function.
33508,16,Column '%.*ls' cannot be passed as a parameter for a BLOCK security predicate because the column definition contains an expression using a window function. Modify the BLOCK security predicates for this view to not use this column.
33509,16,Column '%.*ls' cannot be passed as a parameter for an AFTER UPDATE or AFTER INSERT BLOCK security predicate for this view because it refers to a base table that is not being modified in this statement. Modify the AFTER INSERT and AFTER UPDATE BLOCK security predicates for this view to not use this column.
33510,16,BLOCK security predicates cannot reference history tables. Table '%.*ls' is a temporal or ledger history table.
33511,16,Table '%.*ls' is memory optimized. Only security policies with schema binding enabled may specify security predicates for memory optimized tables. Create a new security policy with schema binding enabled.
33512,16,Binding for the non-schema bound security predicate on object '%.*ls' failed with one or more errors, indicating the schema of the predicate function has changed. Update or drop the affected security predicates.
33513,16,Binding for the non-schema bound security predicate on object '%.*ls' failed, because the predicate function is not an inline table-valued function. Only inline table-valued functions can be used for security predicates.
33514,16,Incorrect encryption metadata was received from the client. The error occurred during the invocation of the batch and therefore the client can refresh the encryption metadata by calling sp_describe_parameter_encryption and retry.
33515,16,The parameter "%.*ls" does not have the same encryption information as the one it was created with. Use sp_refresh_parameter_encryption to refresh the parameter encryption information for the module.
33516,16,The object '%.*ls' is referenced by the security policy '%.*ls'. The currently installed edition of SQL Server does not support security policies. Either drop the security policy or upgrade the instance of SQL Server to a version that supports security policies.
33517,16,The column '%.*ls' of the object '%.*ls' is encrypted. The currently installed edition of SQL Server does not support encrypted columns. Either remove the encryption from the column or upgrade the instance of SQL Server to a version that supports encrypted columns.
33518,16,Valid values of the database compatibility level are %d, %d, %d, or %d.
33519,16,An external data source conflicting with '%.*ls' already exists in EDS cache in memory. Use alter step to change the location or credential. Drop and re-create to change the EDS name.

33523,16,Cryptographic failure due to insufficient memory.
33524,10,The fn_get_audit_file function is skipping records from '%.*ls'. You must be connected to database '%.*ls' to access its audit logs.
33525,10,The fn_get_audit_file function is skipping records from '%.*ls'. You must be connected to server '%.*ls' to access its audit logs.
33526,10,The fn_get_audit_file function is skipping records from '%.*ls', as it does not conform to the auditing blob naming convention.
33527,16,Error occurred while initializing the security functions lookup table. This might be because the installation of SQL Server is corrupted and a required file is missing.
33528,16,Valid values of the database compatibility level are %d, %d, %d, %d, or %d.
33529,16,The audit filter predicate exceeds the maximum allowed length of %d characters.

35201,10,A connection timeout has occurred while attempting to establish a connection to availability replica '%ls' with id [%ls]. Either a networking or firewall issue exists, or the endpoint address provided for the replica is not the database mirroring endpoint of the host server instance.
35202,10,A connection for availability group '%ls' from availability replica '%ls' with id  [%ls] to '%ls' with id [%ls] has been successfully established.  This is an informational message only. No user action is required.
35203,16,Unable to establish a connection between instance '%ls' with id [%ls] and '%ls' with id [%ls] due to a transport version mismatch.
35204,10,The connection between server instances '%ls' with id [%ls] and '%ls' with id [%ls] has been disabled because the database mirroring endpoint was either disabled or stopped. Restart the endpoint by using the ALTER ENDPOINT Transact-SQL statement with STATE = STARTED.
35205,16,Could not start the Always On Availability Groups transport manager. This failure probably occurred because a low memory condition existed when the message dispatcher started up. If so, other internal tasks might also have experienced errors. Check the SQL Server error log and the Windows error log for additional error messages. If a low memory condition exists, investigate and correct its cause.
35206,10,A connection timeout has occurred on a previously established connection to availability replica '%ls' with id [%ls].  Either a networking or a firewall issue exists or the availability replica has transitioned to the resolving role.
35207,16,Connection attempt on availability group id '%ls' from replica id '%ls' to replica id '%ls' failed because of error %d, severity %d, state %d.
35208,16,Availability group DDL operations are permitted only when you are using the master database.  Run the 'USE master' statement, and retry your availability group DDL statement.
35209,16,The %ls operation failed for availability replica '%.*ls', because the backup priority value is outside the valid range. The valid range is between %d and %d, inclusive. Set the backup priority to a value within this range, and retry the operation.
35210,16,Failed to modify options for availability replica '%.*ls' in availability group '%.*ls'. The specified availability group does not contain an availability replica with specified name. Verify that availability group name and availability replica name are correct, then retry the operation.
35211,16,The %ls operation is not allowed.  The operation attempted to change the configuration of availability replica '%.*ls' to the asynchronous-commit availability mode with automatic failover, which is an invalid configuration.  Either change the failover mode to manual or the availability mode to synchronous commit, and retry the operation.
35212,16,The %ls operation is not allowed by the current availability group configuration.  This operation would exceed the maximum number of %d synchronous-commit availability replicas in availability group '%.*ls'.  Change one of the existing synchronous-commit replicas to the asynchronous-commit availability mode, and retry the operation.
35213,16,The %ls operation is not allowed by the current availability group configuration.  This operation would exceed the maximum number of %d automatic failover targets in availability group '%.*ls'.  Change one of the existing synchronous-commit replicas to the manual failover mode, and retry the operation.
35214,16,The %ls operation failed for availability replica '%.*ls'.  The minimum value for session timeout is %d.  Retry the operation specifying a valid session-timeout value.
35215,16,The %ls operation is not allowed on availability replica '%.*ls', because automatic failover mode is an invalid configuration on a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance.  Retry the operation by specifying manual failover mode.
