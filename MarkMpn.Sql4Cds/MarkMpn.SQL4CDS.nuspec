    <description>SQL 4 CDS allows you to use standard SQL syntax to query and manipulate your data and metadata in Dataverse / D365.

Supports
- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

Where possible the queries are converted to FetchXML, allowing you to generate FetchXML queries for
plugins or integrations by writing familiar SQL and converting it.

Using the preview TDS Endpoint, SELECT queries can also be run that aren't convertible to FetchXML.</description>
